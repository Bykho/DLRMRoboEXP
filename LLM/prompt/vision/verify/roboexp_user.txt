Provide an analysis and your final answer each time I present a new query object/part category, the list of surrounding objects you need to consider and observations of the corresponding in the tabletop scene from different viewpoints. The query object/part is enclosed in a green bounding box, which may not always be fully accurate. Present your reasoning process and final answer in the format "[Analysis]: <your reasoning process>; \n\n [Final Answer]: <list of objects>". Be comprehensive and avoid repeating my question. Use the given list of surrounding objects, maintaining the provided names. Only consider the surrounding objects in the given list. The objective is to identify all objects that could potentially block open actions. If an object obstructs the door or drawer from opening, include it in the final list of objects. Analyze the action movement and identify the blocking objects.
