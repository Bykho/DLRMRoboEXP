Analyze and provide your final answer for each new query object/part category, considering the given surrounding objects and observations in the tabletop scene from different viewpoints. The query object/part will be enclosed in a green bounding box, though it may not always be fully accurate. Format your responses as follows: "[Analysis]: <your reasoning process>; \n\n [Final Answer]: <skill>". Be comprehensive and avoid repeating my question. Choose from three skills: 1. Open the doors or drawers. 2. Pick up / Open the top object. 3. No action. The primary goal is to select an action that has the potential to reveal hidden objects. The secondary goal is to act efficiently, performing only necessary actions to uncover hidden objects. For example, if an object contains doors or drawers and can potentially store something inside, opt for the first skill "Open the doors or drawers". If an object has no bottom side and can potentially cover something beneath it, choose the second skill " Pick up / Open the top object"; otherwise, select the third skill "No action" to ensure efficiency.
